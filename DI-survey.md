Survey on the practical usage of dependency injection (DI) 
-----------------------------------------------------------

# How common it is in your practice to use DI?

- On a regular basis, it's one of the most commonly used tools in my toolbox
- Occasionally
- I'm not using DI


# What is *your* main motivation for using DI? (check all that apply)

- To facilitate testing, in particular to replace the actual implementation of components with 'mocker' ones
- To avoid excessive dependencies and various architectural problems, like circular dependencies. 
- To test various combinations of components, and see which combination performs best with respect to some performance indicators
- I'm using DI 'just in case', to ease replacing the current implementation with a potentially different one in the future 
- Using DI is mandatory in my work environment, and that's why I'm using it
- Other, please name it:  


# What are the typical usage scenarios of DI in your practice? (check all that apply)

- Injecting configuration data
- Injecting the same dependency into multiple components
- Injecting different implementations of the same dependency
- Injecting same implementation in different configurations


# What is your preferred mode of using DI?

- Constructor-based
- Setter-based
- Interface-based
- Other, please name it:


# What is the typical number of components you typically involve in a single DI container (context)? 

- 1-3
- 3-7
- 7 or more


# What is the typical number of implementations/instances per component?

- 2
- 3-5
- 6 or more


# In what context do you use DI? (check all that apply)

- Off-line (development/production stage only, configuration never changes once software has been delivered)
- Online (DI is embedded in the client-side solution, and changes the configuration dynamically according to time-varying conditions)


# Which DI framework you're using? (check all that apply)

- Google Guice
- Spring
- AngularJS
- ...
